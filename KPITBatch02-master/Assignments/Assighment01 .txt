2. write a code to generate prime numbers between 150 and 50 and also get the count of it


3. write a code to generate fobanocci series

4. wrtie a code to find the next number

     1=1!
     2=2!
    145=1!+4!+5!
    	1 + 24 + 120
	145

what is the next number that satisfies this condition

5. write a code to generate armstrong series

6.Calculate the area of a rectangle given its length and width.

7.Convert a temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit using the formula: F = (C * 9/5) + 32.

8.Calculate the area of a circle given its radius using the formula: A = π * r^2.

9.Compute the hypotenuse of a right triangle using the Pythagorean theorem: c = sqrt(a^2 + b^2).

10.Calculate the simple interest on an investment using the formula: A = P * T * R / 100;

11.Calculate the compound interest on an investment using the formula: A = P * (1 + r/n)^(n*t).

12.Determine the volume of a sphere given its radius using the formula: V = (4/3) * π * r^3.

13.Convert a distance from kilometers to miles using the formula: miles = kilometers * 0.621371.

14.Calculate the sum of the first n natural numbers using the formula: sum = (n * (n + 1)) / 2.

15.Compute the area of a triangle given the lengths of its three sides using Heron's formula.

The formula is as follows:

s = (a + b + c) / 2
A = sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c))

where:

a, b, and c are the lengths of the triangle's sides.
s is the semiperimeter (half of the perimeter) of the triangle.
A is the area of the triangle.
