2. Consider an array Z = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14], how to generate an array R = [[1,2,3,4], [2,3,4,5], [3,4,5,6], ..., [11,12,13,14]]? (★★★)

3. Compute a matrix rank (★★★)

4. How to find the most frequent value in an array?

5. Extract all the contiguous 3x3 blocks from a random 10x10 matrix 

6. Create a 2D array subclass such that Z[i,j] == Z[j,i] 

7. Consider a set of p matrices with shape (n,n) and a set of p vectors with shape (n,1). How to compute the sum of of the p matrix products at once? (result has shape (n,1)) 

8. Consider a 16x16 array, how to get the block-sum (block size is 4x4)? 

9. How to implement the Game of Life using numpy arrays? 

10. How to get the n largest values of an array 

11. Given an arbitrary number of vectors, build the cartesian product (every combinations of every item) 

12. How to create a record array from a regular array? 

13. Consider a large vector Z, compute Z to the power of 3 using 3 different methods 

14. Consider two arrays A and B of shape (8,3) and (2,2). How to find rows of A that contain elements of each row of B regardless of the order of the elements in B? 

15. Considering a 10x3 matrix, extract rows with unequal values (e.g. [2,2,3]) 

16. Convert a vector of ints into a matrix binary representation 

17. Given a two dimensional array, how to extract unique rows? 

18. Considering 2 vectors A & B, write the einsum equivalent of inner, outer, sum, and mul function 

19. Considering a path described by two vectors (X,Y), how to sample it using equidistant samples?

20. Given an integer n and a 2D array X, select from X the rows which can be interpreted as draws from a multinomial distribution with n degrees, i.e., the rows which only contain integers and which sum to n. 

21. Compute bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals for the mean of a 1D array X (i.e., resample the elements of an array with replacement N times, compute the mean of each sample, and then compute percentiles over the means).
